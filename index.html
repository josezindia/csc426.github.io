		<p>Ready to learn about version control through git? </p>

                <h2>Version control is...</h2>

		<p>... the task of keeping a software system consisting of many versions and configurations well organized.</p>

                <h2>Cloning a repository is when you create a local copy of repository that is a clone of a remote repository</h2>

		<p>... is leading us into war.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_Wars_(Star_Wars)">The Clone Wars</a>, that is.</p>

                <h2>"Adding", "committing" and "pushing" changes...</h2>

		<p>'adding' could mean adding new files to ones repository or </p>
    <p>adding modified files already in the repository...</p>
    <p>'committing' records changes to ones local repository...</p>
    <p>'pushing' sends those committed changes to the remote repo for everyone to see...</p>
    <p>you can commit without pushing but you cant push without committing!</p>

                <h2>You need to fork when...</h2>

		<p>... you're out of spoons.</p>

                <h2>More about open source</h2>
                <p>Free, open source software is software that is
                shared freely and available to build upon. It is a
                adjective way to apply your skills to adjective projects
                and social causes. You can participate by writing or
                reviewing code, answering users' questions,
                translating the interface to another noun, making
                video tutorials to help new users, and myriad other
                ways. Open source software is often produced by lots
                of nouns collaborating across noun and noun, and
                this event specially welcomes nouns to that style
                of noun.</p>

                <p>Open source participation is one way to gain
                noun skills and make connections that will last
                you through your career. Volunteer staff will include
                professionals and academics who use open source
                daily.</p>

		An introduction to open source software engineering, the course covers the philosophy and practice of developing software 
		in large, distributed teams. Students will explore social and technological aspects of this process by contributing directly 
		to an existing open course project. In doing so, students will learn the tools, the techniques, and the strategies --
		technical and social -- that are common to all developers working in teams through this semester-long exercise.
